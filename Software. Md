Network Architecture Overview

This document outlines the full network design of Project Hydra

Topology

Primary LAN (Air-Gapped)

All nodes and controllers live on a dedicated, isolated VLAN.

No direct Internet access except via VPN tunnels.


VPN Exit Node (OpenWRT Router on CM4)

Manages all VPN connections.

Routes outgoing traffic through rotating VPN providers.

Handles MAC address spoofing and IP rotation policies.

Firewall rules enforced strict egress paths only.


VPN Providers Used

Private Internet Access (PIA)

NordVPN


Storage Network (iSCSI/NFS)

Drobo 800fs serves 18TB over dedicated internal network.

Jumbo frames enabled for better throughput.


Cluster Control Network (Admin Only)

Separated NIC/interface purely for cluster management traffic (Kubernetes).

Kubernetes Layout

Full k8s cluster built using:

kubeadm for initialization

Calico for network overlay

MetalLB for load balancing

Custom node labels for workload specialization



Node Roles

RPi4s — General Purpose Compute Nodes

Jetson Nanos — Specialized for ML/AI tasks (e.g., view generation, video decoding)

CM3s — Lightweight service runners (heartbeat checkers, watchers, etc.)

CM4s — Router functions, VPN, cluster internal services

Key Security & Anti-Fingerprinting Measures

VPN Rotation:

Every 30 minutes, all nodes received fresh VPN tunnel IPs.

VPN endpoint locations randomized between providers.


MAC Address Randomization:

CM4 OpenWRT node randomized DHCP MACs and static MACs periodically.


Disk Reimage Strategy:

Every 30 minutes, lightweight nodes reinstalled clean OS images from local server.

Wiped residual temp/cache/OS fingerprints.


DNS Obfuscation:

Custom DNS resolver setup inside OpenWRT.

Queries routed through anonymized chains.


Connection Lifespan Enforcement:

Forced connection resets to avoid building long session fingerprints.

Final Thoughts

> "Cluster until they trust ya, rotate until they can't catch ya."
